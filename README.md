# good

[**hapi**](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi) process monitoring

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/hapijs/good.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/hapijs/good)

**good** is a hapi plugin to monitor and report on a variety of hapi server events as well as ops information from the host machine. It listens for events emitted by hapi server instances and pushes standardized events to a collection of streams.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');

const server = Hapi.server();

const options = {
    ops: {
        interval: 1000
    },
    reporters: {
        myConsoleReporter: [
            {
                module: '@hapi/good-squeeze',
                name: 'Squeeze',
                args: [{ log: '*', response: '*' }]
            },
            {
                module: '@hapi/good-console'
            },
            'stdout'
        ]
    }
};

await server.register({
    plugin: require('@hapi/good'),
    options,
});

await server.start();

console.info(`Server started at ${ server.info.uri }`);

```
