## Good

**good** is a process monitor that listens for one or more of the below 'event types'. All of these events, _except_ 'ops' and 'wreck',  map to a hapi event documented [here](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#server-events).

*_'Monitor'_ should be configured using a _'hapi'_ server instead of calling the _'Monitor'_ constructor directly.*

## Options

Applications with multiple server instances, each with its own monitor should only include one _log_ subscription per destination
as general events are a process-wide facility and will result in duplicated log events. To override some or all of the defaults,
set `options` to an object with the following optional settings:

- `[requestHeaders]` - determines if all request headers will be available to `reporter` objects. Defaults to _false_
- `[requestPayload]` - determines if the request payload will be available to `reporter` objects. Defaults to _false_
- `[responsePayload]` - determines if the response payload will be available to `reporter` objects. Defaults to _false_
- `[ops]` - options passed directly into the [`Oppsy`](https://github.com/hapijs/oppsy#new-oppsyserver-config) constructor. Defaults to `{}`.
    - `config` - options passed directly into the `Oppsy` constructor as the `config` value.
    - `interval` - interval used when calling `Oppsy.start()`.
- `[responseEvent]` - the event type used to capture completed requests. Defaults to 'tail'. Options are:
    - 'response' - the response was sent but request tails may still be pending.
    - 'tail' - the response was sent and all request tails completed.
- `[extensions]` - an array of [hapi event names](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#server-events) to listen for and report via the good reporting mechanism. Can not be any of ['log', 'request-error', 'ops', 'request', 'response', 'tail']. **Disclaimer** This option should be used with caution. This option will allow users to listen to internal events that are not meant for public consumption. The list of available events can change with any changes to the hapi event system. Also, *none* of the official hapijs reporters have been tested against these custom events. Also, the schema for these events can not be guaranteed because the hapi results can change.
- `[reporters]` - Defaults to *no* reporters. All reporting objects must be installed in your project. `reporters` is an array of instantiated objects that implement the good-reporter interface or an object with the following keys:
    - `reporter` - indicates the reporter object to create. Can be one of two values
        - a constructor function generally via `require`, ie `require('good-file')`
        - a module name to `require`. Uses the built-in Node `require` function so you can pass a module name or a path. The supplied module must implement the good-reporter interface.
    - `events` - an object of key value pairs:
        - `key` - one of the supported good events or any of the `extensions` events that this reporter should listen for
        - `value` - a single string or an array of strings to filter incoming events base on the event's `tag` value. "\*" indicates no filtering. `null` and `undefined` are assumed to be "\*"
    - `config` - an implementation specific configuration value used to instantiate the reporter
- `[filter]` - an object with the following keys:
    - `key` - the key of the data property to change
    - `value` - a string that can be one of the following:
        - "censor" - replace the text with "X"s
        - "remove" - `delete`s the value
        - a valid regular express string. Only supports a single group. Ex: `"(\\d{4})$"` will replace the last four digits with "X"s. Take extra care when creating this string. You will need to make sure that the resultant RegExp object is what you need.

    `filter` can be used to remove potentially sensitive information (credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.) from the log payloads before they are sent out to reporters. This setting only impacts `response` events and only if payloads are included via `requestPayload` and `responsePayload`. `filter` is intended to impact the reporting of ALL downstream reporters. If you want filtering in only one, you will need to create a customized reporter. The filtering is done recursively so if you want to "censor" `ccn`, anywhere `ccn` appears in request or response bodies will be "censor"ed. Currently, you can only filter leaf nodes; nothing with children.

## Event Types

- `ops` - System and process performance - CPU, memory, disk, and other metrics.
- `response` - Information about incoming requests and the response. This maps to either the "response" or "tail" event emitted from hapi servers.
- `log` - logging information not bound to a specific request such as system errors, background processing, configuration errors, etc. Maps to the "log" event emitted from hapi servers.
- `error` - request responses that have a status code of 500. This maps to the "request-error" hapi event.
- `request` - Request logging information. This maps to the hapi 'request' event that is emitted via `request.log()`.
- `wreck` - Wreck module request/response logging information.  Note: Wreck has to be in the top level package.json in order for this to work due to it being a singleton.

## Event Payloads

Each event emitted from Good has a unique object representing the payload. This is useful for three reasons:

1. It provides a predictable interface.
2. It makes tracking down issues with MDB much easier because the payloads aren't just generic objects.
3. It is more likely to be optimized because the V8 runtime has a better idea of what the structure of each object is going ot be much sooner.

**All** of the below events are frozen to prevent tampering. If your reporter uses "strict mode", trying to change the value will throw an error.

#### `GreatLog(event)`

Event object associated with 'log' events. The `event` argument is the `event` argument emitted by hapi 'log' events.

- `event` - 'log'
- `timestamp` - JavaScript timestamp indicating when the 'log' event occurred.
- `tags` - array of strings representing any tags associated with the 'log' event.
- `data` - string or object passed via `server.log()` calls.
- `pid` - the current process id.

#### `GreatError(request, error)`

Event object associated with 'error' events. `request` and `error` are the objects sent by hapi on 'request-error' events.

- `event` - 'error'
- `timestamp` - JavaScript timestamp indicating when the 'log' event occurred.
- `id` - request id. Maps to `request.id`.
- `url` - url of the request that originated the error. Maps to `request.url`.
- `method` - method of the request that originated the error. Maps to `request.method`.
- `pid` - the current process id.
- `error` - the raw error object.

The `toJSON` method of `GreatError` has been overwritten because `Error` objects can not be stringified directly. A stringified `GreatError` will have `error.message` and `error.stack` in place of the raw `Error` object.

#### `GreatResponse(request, options)`

Event object associated with the `responseEvent` event option into Good. `request` is the `request` object emitted by the 'tail' or 'response' event by hapi. `options` is an object used for additional logging options.

- `event` - 'response'
- `timestamp` - JavaScript timestamp that maps to `request.info.received`.
- `id` - id of the request, maps to `request.id`.
- `instance` - maps to `request.connection.info.uri`.
- `labels` - maps to `request.connection.settings.labels`
- `method` - method used by the request. Maps to `request.method`.
- `path` - incoming path requested. Maps to `request.path`.
- `query` - query object used by request. Maps to `request.query`.
- `responseTime` - calculated value of `Date.now() - request.info.received`.
- `statusCode` - the status code of the response.
- `pid` - the current process id.
- `httpVersion` - the http protocol information from the request.
- `source` - object with the following values:
    - `remoteAddress` - information about the remote address. maps to `request.info.remoteAddress`
    - `userAgent` - the user agent of the incoming request.
    - `referer` - the referer headed of the incoming request.
- `log` - maps to `request.getLog()` of the hapi request object.

Optional properties controlled by the `options` argument into Good.

- `headers` - the header object for the incomming request.
- `requestPayload` - maps to `request.payload`.
- `responsePayload` - maps to `request.response.source`.

#### `GreatOps(ops)`

- `event` - 'ops'
- `timestamp` - current time when the object is created.
- `host` - the host name of the current machine.
- `pid` - the current process id.
- `os` - object with the following values:
    - `load` - array containing the 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages.
    - `mem` - object with the following values:
        - `total` - total system memory in bytes.

    - `concurrents` - object containing information about the number of concurrent connections associated with each `listener` object associated with the hapi server.
    - `responseTimes` - object with calculated average and max response times for requests.
    - `sockets` - object with the following values:
        - `http` - socket information http connections. Each value contains the name of the socket used and the number of open connections on the socket. It also includes a `total` for total number of open http sockets.
        - `https` - socket information https connections. Each value contains the name of the socket used and the number of open connections on the socket. It also includes a `total` for total number of open https sockets.

#### `GreatRequest(request, event)`

Event object associated with the "request" event. This is the hapi event emitter via `request.log()`. `request` and `events` are the parameters passed by hapi when emitting the "request" event.

    - `headers` - object containing all incoming response headers
- `error` - if the response errored, this field will be populated
    - `message` - the error message
    - `stack` - the stack trace of the error

## Reporter Interface

When creating a custom good reporter, it needs to implement the following interface:
- A constructor function (will always be invoked with `new`) with the following signature `function (events, config)` where:
    - `events` - an object of key value pairs:
        - `key` - one of the supported good events or any of the `extensions` events that this reporter should listen for
        - `value` - a single string or an array of strings to filter incoming events. "\*" indicates no filtering. `null` and `undefined` are assumed to be "\*"
    - `config` - an implementation specific configuration value used to instantiate the reporter
- An optional `attributes` key set on the constructor function with a `name` key set to a string that identifies the reporter. `pkg.name` is also acceptable alternative in the style of hapi plugins. Used for error reporting
- An `init` method with the following signature `function init (readstream, emitter, callback)` where:
    - `readstream` - the incoming [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) from good. This stream is always in `objectMode`.
    - `emitter` - the good event emitter. The `emitter` will emit the following events:
    - `stop` - always emitted when the hapi server is shutting down. Perform any tear-down logic in this event handler

```javascript
var Squeeze = require('good-squeeze').Squeeze;

function GoodReporterExample (events, config) {

    if (!(this instanceof GoodReporterExample)) {
        return new GoodReporterExample(events, config);
    }

    this.squeeze = Squeeze(events);
}

GoodReporterExample.prototype.init = function (readstream, emitter, callback) {

    readstream.pipe(this.squeeze).pipe(process.stdout);
    emitter.on('stop', function () {

        console.log('some clean up logic.');
    });
    callback();
}

GoodReporterExample.attributes = {
    name: 'good-reporter-example'
}
```
